**Part 1:**

Continuous data is a type of numerical data type that can take any value within a range of numbers. For example, height and weight are each continuous data, as someoneâ€™s height or weight can be any value!
Ordinal data is a qualitative type of data, where the rank is what matters. One example of this is the results of a boat race, and a ranking of the different contenders based on time taken to complete.
Nominal data is data that does not have a specific value, but rather fits into a specific category. An example of this would be the continent a country belongs to, male or female, or eye color.

A model you could use is a competition on rowing machines where each contender rows 2 kilometers. Nominal data would be whether each contestant is male or female. Continuous data would be the time each person takes to row this length. Ordinal would be the rank of each person based on time.

The plot after logarithmic transformation best shows the change in life expectancy from 1952 to 2007. This is because it helps show the trend more clearly. Logarithmic transformations shrink values while retaining proportional share towards the overall metric, which helps to make the pattern more visible.

The one that best communicates the change in population amongst all of these countries from 1952 to 2007 is the plot using the raw data. While it is easier to see the quartiles in the logarithmic data, and the box and whiskers plots are less cramped together, it is harder to visualize the overall trend that has taken place. This is because it makes plots look relatively the same over time, whereas the raw data highlights the increase in population. The raw data also has all of the outliers, which the logarithmic data does not.
